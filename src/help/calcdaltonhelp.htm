<p>The aim of
the program is to suggest photolinker positions for single base extension
primers (SBE-primers) in multiplex reactions. The suggested photolinker
positions are optimised for best resolution in SBE-product analysis via mass
spectrometry.</p>

<p>A multiplex
up to a ten-plex can be calculated – so at maximum 10 SBE-Primers can be
analysed.</p>

<p>When the
program is started, the highest multiplex-number (1-10) to be analysed needs to
be specified:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For
example: When a pentaplex and a triplex should be analysed, “5” must be
entered. </p>

<p>In the
following screen you can copy and paste primer sequences into the appropriate
SBE-Primer fields using the &quot;Ctrl-C&quot; (copy) and &quot;Ctrl-V&quot;
(paste) key combinations.</p>



<p><img src="./pics/image003.png"></p>



<p>The first
SBE-Primer always has to be entered.</p>

<p>The primer
sequences must include the nucleotide which will be replaced by the
photolinker.</p>

<p>The minimum
primer length corresponds to the highest photolinker position, e.g. when you
allow the program to insert photolinkers up to the 12<sup>th</sup> base
position counting from the 3’ end, 12 bases is the minimum primer length. </p>



<p>Note that
you do not have to enter primer sequences in all SBE-Primer fields. </p>



<p>Next you
should specify which ddNTPs will be present in the primer extension reaction.
Click with the left mouse button on the appropriate fields. </p>



<p>At the
field “Photolinker at:” you can choose “auto” to let the program suggest
optimal photolinker positions. You can also specify a fixed photolinker
position. </p>



<p>In the menu
option “Settings” (Alt-K) you can modify how photolinkers are chosen. </p>



<p><img src="./pics/image005.png"></p>

<p>Here you
can specify which positions, counting from the 3´-end of the SBE-Primer are
allowed to be replaced by a photolinker.  </p>

<p>The order
of the positions (starting from the top of the list) specifies the preferred
usage. E.g. in the picture above the 9<sup>th</sup> position is preferred to the 8<sup>th</sup>
position which is preferred to the 10<sup>th</sup> position and so on.
Selecting a position and clicking the &quot;Up&quot; and &quot;Down&quot;
buttons changes this order. You can also add and delete positions. </p>



<p>The field
“Excluded peak distances (D)” allows to exclude mass distances (in Dalton)
between primers and SBE products. This allows to generate sets of primers where
the extension products can be detected in the mass spectrometer without overlap
between products and /or secondary peaks due to sodium, potassium or other
cations. Note that the excluded distances do not apply to primer extension products resulting from the same primer.
E.g. an excluded distance from 20 to 26 D does not conflict with the 24
D-distance between an SBE-Primer extended with C and an SBE-Primer extended
with A.  </p>

<p>You can
delete and add excluded distances. </p>



<p>You can
specify a “Minimum peak distance (D):”. Setting a minimum peak distance helps
to account for the mass resolution of your system and improves the robustness
of the assays. As explained above, this distance does not apply to the
distances of primer extension products
resulting from the same primer. </p>



<p>To save the
settings or load previously saved settings change to the “Save settings” card
and push “Save settings “ or “Load last saved settings” . By this procedure the
file “calcdalton.cfg” is written or loaded. This file is located in the same
directory as the CalcDalton.jar file. </p>

<p>Alternatively
you can revert to the initial settings by pushing "Reset to standard settings" </p>

<p>Note that
when CalcDalton ist started the last saved settings are loaded by default. </p>





<p>To leave
the settings menu click “Okay” in “Settings”.  </p>



<p>To start
the calculation, push “Calculate” in the main input screen. You can switch
between results by pushing “Previous result” and “Next result”. </p>





<p><img src="./pics/image007.png"></p>





<p>The results
can be marked with the mouse and copied and pasted into other applications
using the &quot;Ctrl-C&quot; and &quot;Ctrl-V&quot; key combinations. </p>



<p>Algorithm
information: </p>

<p><br>
The mass of a primer fragment after cleavage is calculated as follows: </p>



<p>First, the
masses for each nucleotide are added: </p>



<p >dA: 313,22 D<br>
dG: 329,22 D<br>
dT: 304,21 D<br>
dC: 289,18 D<br>
<br>
ddA: 297,22 D<br>
ddG: 313,2 D<br>
ddT: 288,1 D<br>
ddC: 273,2 D<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>Second, the
effective weight of a phosphate (61,98 D) is subtracted. </p>



<p>Third, the
weight of the photolinker after cleavage (+ 80 D) is added.  </p>
